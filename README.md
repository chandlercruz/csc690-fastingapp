# CSC690 Final Project - Fasting App

Chandler Cruz

**Proposal**
Our application will be a fasting app which will keep track of the user's daily fasts. The user will choose their fast (ex: 16:8, with 16 hours fasting and 8 hours of eating), and the app will use that setting to keep track of how much time is left in a user's fast. 
A user can set the start time of their fast, and the app will keep track of how much time is left before their fast ends. Once the user indicates that their fast is complete, that fast will be added to a list of the user's prior fasts for them to browse. In addition, the user will be able to browse statistics such as their total time fasted, and average fast length.
